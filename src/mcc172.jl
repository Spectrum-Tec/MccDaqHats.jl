"""
	mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read(address::Integer)

Read the sampling clock configuration.

This function will return the sample clock configuration and rate. If the clock is configured for local or master source, then the rate will be the internally adjusted rate set by the user. If the clock is configured for slave source, then the rate will be measured from the master clock after the synchronization period has ended. The synchronization status is also returned.

The clock source will be one of the following values:

	SOURCE_LOCAL = 0: The clock is generated on this MCC 172 and not shared with other MCC 172s.
	SOURCE_MASTER = 1: The clock is generated on this MCC 172 and is shared as the master clock for other MCC 172s.

it only monitors the clock when a sync is initiated.

"""
	mcc172_a_in_clock_config_write(address::Integer, clock_source::Symbol, sample_rate_per_channel::Real)

Write the sampling clock configuration.

This function will configure the ADC sampling clock. The default 
configuration after opening the device is local mode, 51.2 KHz data rate.

The clock_source must be one of:

	SOURCE_LOCAL (0): The clock is generated on this MCC 172 and not shared with other MCC 172s.
	SOURCE_MASTER (1): The clock is generated on this MCC 172 and is shared as the master clock for other MCC 172s. All other MCC 172s must be configured for local or slave clock.
	SOURCE_SLAVE (2): No clock is generated on this MCC 172, it receives its clock from the master MCC 172.

The ADCs will be synchronized so they sample the inputs at the same time. 
This requires 128 clock cycles before the first sample is available. 
When using a master - slave clock configuration for multiple MCC 172s 
there are additional considerations:

There should be only one master device; otherwise, you will be connecting 
multiple outputs together and could damage a device.
Configure the clock on the slave device(s) first, master last. The 
synchronization will occur when the master clock is configured, causing 
the ADCs on all the devices to be in sync.

If you change the clock configuration on one device after configuring the
 master, then the data will no longer be in sync. The devices cannot 
 detect this and will still report that they are synchronized. Always 
 write the clock configuration to all devices when modifying the configuration.
Slave devices must have a master clock source or scans will never complete.
A trigger must be used for the data streams from all devices to start 
on the same sample.

The MCC 172 can generate an ADC sampling clock equal to 51.2 kHz divided 
by an integer between 1 and 256. The `data_rate_per_channel` will be 
internally converted to the nearest valid rate. The actual rate can be 
read back using `mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read()`. When used in slave clock 
configuration, the device will measure the frequency of the incoming 
master clock after the synchronization period is complete. Calling 
`mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read()` after this will return the measured data rate.

	Return: Result code, RESULT_SUCCESS if successful
Parameters:

	address: The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.
	clock_source: The ADC clock source, one of the source type values.

"""
	mcc172_trigger_config(address::Integer, source::SourceType, mode::TriggerMode)

Configure the digital trigger.

The analog input scan may be configured to start saving the acquired 
data when the digital trigger is in the desired state. A single device 
trigger may also be shared with multiple boards. This command sets the 
trigger source and mode.

The trigger source must be one of:

	SOURCE_LOCAL (0): The trigger terminal on this MCC 172 is used and not shared with other MCC 172s.
	SOURCE_MASTER (1): The trigger terminal on this MCC 172 is used and is shared as the master trigger for other MCC 172s.
	SOURCE_SLAVE (2): The trigger terminal on this MCC 172 is not used, it receives its trigger from the master MCC 172.
The trigger mode must be one of:

	TRIG_RISING_EDGE: Start the scan on a rising edge of TRIG.
	TRIG_FALLING_EDGE: Start the scan on a falling edge of TRIG.
	TRIG_ACTIVE_HIGH: Start the scan any time TRIG is high.
	TRIG_ACTIVE_LOW: Start the scan any time TRIG is low.

Due to the nature of the filtering in the A/D converters there is an 
input delay of 39 samples, so the data coming from the converters at any 
time is delayed by 39 samples from the current time. This is most 
noticeable when using a trigger - there will be approximately 39 samples 
prior to the trigger event in the captured data.

Care must be taken when using master / slave triggering; the input 
trigger signal on the master will be passed through to the slave(s), 
but the mode is set independently on each device. For example, it is 
possible for the master to trigger on the rising edge of the signal 
and the slave to trigger on the falling edge.

	Return: Result code, RESULT_SUCCESS if successful.
Parameters:

	address: The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.
	source: The trigger source, one of the source type values.
	mode: The trigger mode, one of the trigger mode values.

"""
	mcc172_a_in_scan_start(address::Integer, channel_mask::UInt8, samples_per_channel::UInt32, options::UInt32)

Start capturing analog input data from the specified channels.

The scan runs as a separate thread from the user’s code. The function 
will allocate a scan buffer and read data from the device into that buffer. 
The user reads the data from this buffer and the scan status using the 
`mcc172_a_in_scan_read()` function. `mcc172_a_in_scan_stop()` is used to stop 
a continuous scan, or to stop a finite scan before it completes. The user 
must call `mcc172_a_in_scan_cleanup()` after the scan has finished and all 
desired data has been read; this frees all resources from the scan and 
allows additional scans to be performed.

The scan cannot be started until the ADCs are synchronized, so this 
function will not return until that has completed. It is best to wait 
for sync using `mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read()` before starting the scan.

The scan state has defined terminology:

	Active: mcc172_a_in_scan_start() has been called and the device may be acquiring data or finished with the acquisition. The scan has not been cleaned up by calling mcc172_a_in_scan_cleanup(), so another scan may not be started.
	Running: The scan is active and the device is still acquiring data. Certain functions will return an error because the device is busy.
The valid options are:

	OPTS_NOSCALEDATA: Returns ADC code (a value between AI_MIN_CODE and AI_MAX_CODE) rather than voltage.
	OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA: Return data without the calibration factors applied.
	OPTS_EXTTRIGGER: Hold off the scan (after calling mcc172_a_in_scan_start()) until the trigger condition is met.
	OPTS_CONTINUOUS: Scans continuously until stopped by the user by calling mcc172_a_in_scan_stop() and writes data to a circular buffer. The data must be read before being overwritten to avoid a buffer overrun error. samples_per_channel is only used for buffer sizing.
	OPTS_EXTCLOCK: option is not supported for this device and will return an error.

The options parameter is set to 0 or OPTS_DEFAULT for default operation, 
which is scaled and calibrated data, no trigger, and finite operation.

Multiple options may be specified by ORing the flags. For instance, 
specifying `OPTS_NOSCALEDATA | OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA` will return the values 
read from the ADC without calibration or converting to voltage.

The buffer size will be allocated as follows:

	Finite mode: Total number of samples in the scan
	Continuous mode (buffer size is per channel): Either samples_per_channel or the value in the following table, whichever is greater

Sample Rate	Buffer Size (per channel)

	200-1024 	S/s		1 kS
	1280-10.24 	kS/s	10 kS
	12.8, 25.6, 51.2 	kS/s	100 kS
Specifying a very large value for samples_per_channel could use too much 
of the Raspberry Pi memory. If the memory allocation fails, the function 
will return `RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL`. The allocation could succeed, but 
the lack of free memory could cause other problems in the Raspberry Pi. 
If you need to acquire a high number of samples then it is better to run 
the scan in continuous mode and stop it when you have acquired the 
desired amount of data. If a scan is already active this function will 
return RESULT_BUSY.

Return: 

	Result code, 	
		RESULT_SUCCESS if successful, 
		RESULT_BUSY if a scan is already active.
Parameters:

	address: The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.
	channel_mask: A bit mask of the channels to be scanned. Set each bit to enable the associated channel (0x01 - 0x03.)
	samples_per_channel: The number of samples to acquire for each channel in the scan (finite mode,) or can be used to set a larger scan buffer size than the default value (continuous mode.)

	mcc172_a_in_scan_status(address::Integer)
Reads status and number of available samples from an analog input scan.

The scan is started with `mcc172_a_in_scan_start()` and runs in a 
background thread that reads the data from the board into an internal 
scan buffer. This function reads the status of the scan and amount of 
data in the scan buffer.

Input Parameter:

	address: The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.

Return:

	Result code, 	
		RESULT_SUCCESS if successful, 
		RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL if a scan has not been started under this instance of the device.
	status: Receives the scan status, an ORed combination of the flags (use mcc172_status_decode() for Array of codes):
		STATUS_HW_OVERRUN: The device scan buffer was not read fast enough and data was lost.
		STATUS_BUFFER_OVERRUN: The thread scan buffer was not read by the user fast enough and data was lost.
		STATUS_TRIGGERED: The trigger conditions have been met.
		STATUS_RUNNING: The scan is running.
	samples_per_channel: Receives the number of samples per channel available in the scan thread buffer.

	mcc172_a_in_scan_read(address::Integer, samples_per_channel::UInt32, mcc172_num_channels::Integer, timeout::Float64)
	
Reads status and multiple samples from an analog input scan.

The scan is started with `mcc172_a_in_scan_start()` and runs in a 
background thread that reads the data from the board into an internal 
scan buffer. This function reads the data from the scan buffer, 
and returns the current scan status.

Input Parameters:

	address: The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.
	samples_per_channel: The number of samples per channel to read. Specify -1 to read all available samples in the scan thread buffer, ignoring timeout. If buffer does not contain enough space then the function will read as many samples per channel as will fit in buffer.
	mcc172_num_channels: number of channels required to calculate buffer size
	timeout: The amount of time in seconds to wait for the samples to be read. Specify a negative number to wait indefinitely or 0 to return immediately with whatever samples are available (up to the value of samples_per_channel or buffer_size_samples.)

Return Parameters:

	Result code:	
		RESULT_SUCCESS if successful, 
		RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL if a scan is not active.
	status: Receives the scan status, an ORed combination of the flags (use mcc172_status_decode() for Array of codes):
		STATUS_HW_OVERRUN: The device scan buffer was not read fast enough and data was lost.
		STATUS_BUFFER_OVERRUN: The thread scan buffer was not read by the user fast enough and data was lost.
		STATUS_TRIGGERED: The trigger conditions have been met.
		STATUS_RUNNING: The scan is running.
	buffer: The user data buffer that receives the samples.
	buffer_size_samples: The size of the buffer in samples. Each sample is a double.
	samples_read_per_channel: Returns the actual number of samples read from each channel.
